# is known from other applications like screen.

# E.g. you can press Mod1-i 1 (i.e. first press Mod1-i and then press the
# 1-button) to switch to the first workspace
#
# The idea of this implementation is: If one presses the prefix (in this case
# Mod1-i) except the notification, nothing is really executed but new
# keybindings are added to execute the actually commands (like use_index 0) and
# to unbind the second key level (1..9 and 0) of this keychain. (If you would
# not unbind it, use_index 0 always would be executed when pressing the single
# 1-button).
